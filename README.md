Populate your [Lemmy][lemmy] instance's **All** feed with communities from servers you select. `moco` periodically
fetches the top posts of the top communities on servers to ensure there's always something recent in your instance's 
**All** feed. It'll also subscribe to those communities to keep the posts and comments flowing in.
